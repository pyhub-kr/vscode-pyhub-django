# Test Environment Improvements

## Summary

This document describes the test environment improvements made as part of Issue #13.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Production Dependencies Issue
- Moved `inversify` and `reflect-metadata` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` in package.json
- This resolved the VS Code extension marketplace requirement that extensions should have no production dependencies

### 2. Fixed Test Failures
- Updated test files to use `InMemoryFileSystem` for proper mocking
- Fixed file system stubbing issues in:
  - `projectStructures.test.ts`
  - `userScenarios.test.ts`
  - `integration.test.ts`
- All 95 tests are now passing

### 3. Code Coverage Setup
- Installed code coverage tools: `nyc`, `@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript`, `c8`, `@vscode/test-cli`
- Created `.nycrc.json` configuration file
- Created `.c8rc.json` configuration file
- Added `test:coverage` script to package.json
- Created unit test directory structure
- Added sample unit test for `PythonParser`

### 4. Test Infrastructure
- Created `.mocharc.json` for unit test configuration
- Added `test:unit` script for running unit tests separately
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude coverage reports

## Current Status

- ✅ All tests passing (95 tests)
- ✅ No production dependencies
- ✅ Code coverage tools installed and configured
- ⚠️ Code coverage reporting has limitations due to VS Code extension test environment

## Known Limitations

VS Code extension tests run in a special environment that makes traditional code coverage tools challenging to use. The current setup provides:
- Basic code coverage infrastructure
- Unit test support with coverage
- Integration tests without coverage (due to VS Code test runner limitations)

## Future Improvements

1. Investigate VS Code's official coverage solution when available
2. Increase unit test coverage for core logic
3. Consider separating core logic from VS Code APIs for better testability
4. Implement mutation testing for code quality

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run tests with coverage attempt
npm run test:coverage

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Run linter
npm run lint
```
